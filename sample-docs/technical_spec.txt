TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

System Architecture
===================

Our system is built on a microservices architecture with the following components:

1. API Gateway
   - Technology: Kong
   - Handles routing, authentication, rate limiting
   - Load balanced across 3 instances

2. Application Services
   - User Service: Node.js + Express
   - Document Service: Python + FastAPI
   - Notification Service: Go
   - Analytics Service: Java + Spring Boot

3. Database Layer
   - Primary: PostgreSQL 15 (master-slave replication)
   - Cache: Redis 7 (cluster mode)
   - Search: Elasticsearch 8
   - Object Storage: S3-compatible storage

4. Message Queue
   - Technology: RabbitMQ
   - Used for async task processing
   - Dead letter queue for failed messages

Performance Requirements
========================

- API Response Time: < 200ms (p95)
- Document Upload: < 5s for files up to 10MB
- Concurrent Users: Support 10,000+ simultaneous connections
- Uptime: 99.9% availability SLA

Security Requirements
=====================

- All API endpoints require HTTPS
- JWT tokens expire after 1 hour
- Rate limiting: 100 requests/minute per user
- Data encryption at rest (AES-256)
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

Deployment
==========

- Container orchestration: Kubernetes
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana
- Logging: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

Scaling Strategy
================

- Horizontal scaling for stateless services
- Database read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- CDN for static asset delivery
- Auto-scaling based on CPU and memory metrics
